<p>I'm a <div id="nerd">nerd</div>.</p>
<p>I've done <div id="FIRST">FIRST</div> robotics for 2 years, and got to Mass States level both times (on 3 different teams no less).  The next year I switched to <div id="Vex">Vex</div> and got 47th (out of 90) place in the top division (of 5) at Worlds.  I also have done <div id="DI">Destination Imagination</div> for 8 years, and got to Globals last year.</p>
<p>I've been doing beginner-level CAD for 4 years, and have experience in <div id="Solidworks">SolidWorks</div>, <div id="Autodesk">Autodesk Inventor</div>, and <div id="Tinkercad">Tinkercad</div>.  On top of that, I taught a 3D Printing and Design class at summer camp, teaching kids of ages 7-16.</p>
<p>I've been fencing (<div id="epee">épée</div>) for 8 years, non-competitively so no tournaments or other recognition, although I was a teaching aid for the fencing class at the same camp.  (Although I fence <div id="epee">épée</div> 99% of the time, I am proficient in all 3 weapons.)</p>
<p>I also play video games.  <div id="LoZ">Legend of Zelda</div>, <div id="Portal">Portal</div>, <div id="Pokemon">Pokémon</div>, <div id="LoL">League of Legends</div>, and <div id="FE">Fire Emblem</div> are among my favorites.</p>
<p>My favorite book of all time is <div id="42">The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</div>.  42</p>
