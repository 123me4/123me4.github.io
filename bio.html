<p>I'm a nerd.</p>
<p>I've done FIRST robotics for 2 years, and got to Mass States level both times (on 3 different teams no less).  The next year I switched to Vex and got 47th (out of 90) place in the top division (of 5) at Worlds.  I also have done Destination Imagination for 8 years, and got to Globals last year.</p>
<p>I've been doing beginner-level CAD for 4 years, and have experience in SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor, Sketch Up, and Tinkercad.  On top of that, I taught a 3D Printing and Design class at summer camp, teaching kids of ages 7-16.</p>
<p>I've been fencing (épée) for 8 years, non-competitively so no tournaments or other recognition, although I was a teaching aid for the fencing class at the same camp.  (Although I fence épée 99% of the time, I am proficient in all 3 weapons.)</p>
<p>I also play video games.  Legend of Zelda, Portal, Pokémon, League of Legends, Fire Emblem and Smash Bros. are among my favorites.</p>
<p>My favorite book of all time is The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.  42</p>
